# TheEnd
This personal project involved a complete redesign of the website for The End bar in Sant Gervasi, Barcelona. The goal was to create a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing digital experience that reflects the barâ€™s personality and makes it easy for users to access key information like the menu, events, location, and contact details.
